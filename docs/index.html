    <div class="post"><p>Health care systems world-wide are under pressure due to the high costs associated with disease. Now more than ever, particularly in developed countries, we have access to the latest advancements in medicine. This contrasts with the challenge of making those treatments available to as many patients as possible. It is imperative to find ways maximize the positive impact on the quality of life of patients, while maintaining a sustainable health care system. For this purpose I performed an analysis of Medicare data in the USA. Furthermore I used a drug-disease open database to cluster the costs by disease. I identified the most expensive diseases (mostly chronic diseases such as Diabetes) and the most expensive medicines.</p>

But how do two independent events correlate with each other? In this post, I will use Python to visualize two different series of events, plotting them on top of each other to gain insights from time series data.</p>

    <div class="post"><p>Being able to see the future would be a great superpower (or so one would think). Luckily, it is already possible to <em>model</em> the future using Python to gain insights into a number of problems from many different areas. In marketing, being able to model how successful a new product will be, would be of great use. In this post, I will take a look at how we can model the future revenue of a product by making certain assumptions and running a Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation.</p>
